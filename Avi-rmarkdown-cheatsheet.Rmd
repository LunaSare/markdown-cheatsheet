```{r setup, include=FALSE}

The difference between the file that I see on the terminal and the file on how it displays on GitHub is the different symbols it utilizes to write out different functions or symbols. For example you would use hashtags when you want to indicate headings or ** before and after each word to bold.
## A markdown cheatsheet file
To create headers you use a hashtag symbol (#) at the beginning of a line, for example:

# Level 1
## Level 2
### Level 3

tinytex::install_tinytex()
